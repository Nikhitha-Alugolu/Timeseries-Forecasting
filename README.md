Project Title: ForecastPro - Time Series Forecasting using Machine Learning

Project Overview:

ForecastPro is a machine learning-based system that predicts future values in a time series data. The system utilizes various algorithms and techniques to analyze and model the data, providing accurate and reliable forecasts.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather time series data (e.g., historical sales, weather patterns)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize data for modeling
3. Model Development: Train machine learning models using techniques like:
    - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
    - Exponential Smoothing (ES)
    - Prophet
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE)
5. Forecasting: Generate forecasts for future time periods

Key Features:

1. Accurate Forecasts: Provide accurate and reliable forecasts for time series data
2. Customizable Models: Allow users to select and customize machine learning models
3. Data Visualization: Visualize time series data and forecasts for easy understanding
4. Real-time Forecasting: Generate forecasts in real-time for timely decision-making

Machine Learning Techniques:

1. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA): Model relationships between current and past values
2. Exponential Smoothing (ES): Model smoothing and trend components
3. Prophet: Model seasonality and non-linear trends
4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Model sequential dependencies
5. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: Model long-term dependencies
